# the-messenger-godot
A 2D endless runner in Godot set in Ancient Greece.

This is the basic working prototype with a single obstacle type (a rock) and a single action (the jump) to avoid it.

The font used throughout the game is Droid Serif (https://www.1001fonts.com/droid-serif-font.html).

Current roadmap:

version 0.0.3

add another type of obstacle (tree with low branch) and the matching action (crouching) to avoid it
version 0.0.4

add background layer tiles
add foreground layer tiles
version 0.1.0

add sound fx
